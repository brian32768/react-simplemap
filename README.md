This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I converted it to use Parcel for "start" and "build". This allowed me to remove about 100 packages.

I shamelessly did the "npm run eject" step to get rid of the really elegant react-scripts
thing that bootstrapping created for me.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
